      \begin{flushleft}
      I'm a highly motivated Data Engineer who loves a challenge. My experience ranges from a product startup,
      to EdTech and consulting with roles both managing and as an individual contributor, all within the Data space.
      As a full-stack data engineer, I have experience working on long running, complex technical 
      projects. I enjoy developing advanced solutions in Python, pushing the limits of my knowledge and finding ways of 
      communicating that to a wide breadth of audiences. I'm looking to join a large multi-disciplinary team 
      centered around rigorous engineering.

              pipelines, built CI/CD pipelines
        \item Built a custom quality assessment package in Python, executed automatically in containerised batch jobs that calculates performance
              metrics of transformations and emits results as structured logs before feeding up to a dynamically populated custom Cloudwatch dashboard
        \item Delivered Â£800K worth of technical scoping for a phase of the project, with an excellent margin -- achieved by closely working 
              with both our commercial director and project managers
