    \begin{cvProfile}
      \begin{flushleft}
      I'm a highly motivated Data Engineer who loves a challenge. My experience ranges from a product startup,
      to EdTech and consulting with roles both managing and as an individual contributor, all within the Data space.
      As a full-stack data engineer, I have experience working on long running, complex technical 
      projects. I enjoy developing advanced solutions in Python, pushing the limits of my knowledge and finding ways of 
      communicating that to a wide breadth of audiences. I'm looking to join a large multi-disciplinary team 
      centred around rigorous engineering.
